# CircularStackKit

A SwiftUI view that organizes it's children on a circular path. 

## Flexible Options:
- Set start and end angles of the path to layout children on only the top half of a circle for example.
- Choose to rotate children with the path, or keep children upright always.
- Rotating children can face inward or outward.

## Usage
The content closure gives you indexes for each child view you should return. Use a switch statement in here to provide different views for each index.
